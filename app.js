//create player class
    // runImg, duckImg, jumpImg,, width, height, x/y location? jumpTimer? grounded? set direction or velocity?

//create let variables :
    // ex: score, gravity, game speed

// add horizon to canvas

// set keys as event listeners : 

    //.keydown => duckImg / reduced height
    //.keyup => jumpImg / jumps + use gravity to pull back down
    // Any key starts the game

// Game start function: includes speed, gravity?, score

// set timer = to score (but reformat to display 10 sec = 100points)

//create jump function - .keyup event listener

//create duck function  - .keydown event listener

// create obstacles array: ex: shuttlecock at 0, western auto at 1 or 2. 

// create a function that causes obstacles to spawn. 
    // may be able to include math function to increase the rate at which these spawn 
    // OR game speed increase set to timer intervals

// Game over function: ensure this includes the alert and game is refreshed upon closing the alert
