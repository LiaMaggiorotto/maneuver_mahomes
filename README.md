## User Story

The game automatically starts without prompt.

User may select "how to play" button upon arrival, which will result in a pop up

Obstacles slide from right to left toward Mahomes and as they approach, the user may use the up arrow key to jump or the down arrow key to duck, avoiding collision with the KC Landmarks. 

Difficulty is increased via the rate in which the items approach increases. 

Score is based on the duration of time in which the player avoids obstacles.

Game resets when user hits obstacle and holds the previous highscore.

Once the user obtains 2000 points, they will be donned the new MVP and celebrate with Andy Reid.

User will have the option to return to play Maneuver Mahomes again and Maneuver Mahomes resets.

## Stretch Goals

Making the ground Mahomes runs on loop/animate.

Add clouds and/or raise the height of the horizon to add faint KC skylines. stadiums, fans, Andy Reid, or KC Wolf in the background

Adding lives (3 total) - you can run into 2 obstacles and loose hearts instead of ending the game. 

Maintaining the high score after reset.

This is not a two player game; however, should time (and skill set) allot it, I would consider expanding it to allow either two players OR having multiple characters for the player to choose from.

Add sounds effects to player actions OR background music : Tech N9ne Red Kingdom

Fancy up the pop up using Sweet Alert.
